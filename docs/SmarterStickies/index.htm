		Smarter Stickies was a
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Widgets">Yahoo! Widget</a>.
		I say "was" because Yahoo! terminated support for its widgets in 2012.
		Widgets were small decorative mini-applications that lived constantly on your desktop.
		You could choose from clocks, stock tickers, weather, news feeds, system monitors
		and many other widgets.
		Smarter Stickies provided reminder notes.
		In the course of its six year lifespan,
		it was downloaded about 100,000 times. 
	</p>
	<div class="w3-row photo w3-padding">

		<div class="w3-col l12 m12" style="padding: 0px 16px 16px 0px;">
			<center><img src="stickies-About.jpg" style="max-height:100%" class="w3-image" alt="stickies-About"></center>
		</div>

	</div>

	<p>
		I started using widgets shortly after Yahoo bought the Konfabulator widget engine
		and released it for free.
		There were maybe a dozen sticky note widgets available in the Yahoo! Widget Gallery
		at the time and I tried many but found them lacking.
		To get a widget with the features I wanted, I'd have to write it myself.
		Primarily, I wanted to be able to hide and show individual notes
		while retaining their screen positions (and other attributes) across restarts.
		To be effective reminders, notes should reappear
		and attract your attention at the appropriate time.
		Therefore the widget's slogan:<br>
		<center>"<i>smart enough to stay out of the way, until needed</i>"</center>
	</p>

		<div class="w3-col l12 m12" style="padding: 0px 16px 16px 0px;">
			<a href="help.html" target="_blank" ><center><img src="stickies-Help.jpg" style="max-height:100%" class="w3-image w3-hover-opacity" alt="stickies-Help"></center></a>
		</div>

	</div>

	<p>
		I may have spent more time developing the help for the widget
		than I did on its code.
		One early decision was to provide help as a single HTML file,
		offloading the effort of displaying it to the users' browsers of choice.
		Clicking on this image will open that file in your browser.
		It is the user's manual for the widget.
		It was intended to first educate the user and then to serve as a reference.
		Accordingly, when the widget is first started,
		it offers to display the help file and explains how to find it later.
	</p><p>
		An effective and useful help system was necessary because,
		while I tried to make the user interface intuitive,
		I was writing the widget primarily for myself
		and I wanted it as efficient as practical.
		Accordingly, some operations would be impossible without help.
		See the <b>Alarm Dialog</b> section of the help file for an example.
	</p>
	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<p>
		I submitted version 1.0 to the Yahoo! Widget Gallery in June 2006.
		To my dismay, early users quickly discovered a serious flaw: disappearing stickies.
		Yes, the notes were supposed to be able to be hidden,
		but not so that you couldn't show (or find, or delete) them again.
		Worse yet, some of them had expired alarms and were constantly beeping
		and the engine (version 3) offered no way to remove a widget.

		This image is of a copy of Smarter Stickies' page in the Yahoo Widget Gallery
		taken 12 days after its initial appearance.
		Sadly, the copy did not capture all the elements of the page,
		and what's left is not properly rendered by the modern IE or Chrome.
		The image links to a PDF created from a Firefox rendering.
	</p><p>
		I used the widget's gallery page to provide support.
		Reading the comments in the PDF from the bottom up
		will recount the history of that first bug and its resolution.
		Version 1.1 patched over the problem and version 1.2
		(using the undocumented constructor below) fixed it.

	<p>
		After those first weeks no further flaws were uncovered
		until the change to version 4 of the engine in 2007 broke some functionality.
		Versions 1.5 and 1.6 addressed the problems caused by the engine upgrade.
		The last version I submitted to the gallery in June 2007 was 1.7.
		I continued to support the widget, checking its gallery page occasionally
		for questions or problems not answered or solved already
		by other users.
	</p><p>
		I used Smarter Stickies until 2012
		when I got my first smartphone
		(which more than replaced the widget's functionality).
		My public support also ended that year
		with the closing of the Yahoo! Widget Gallery.
	</p><p>
		Yahoo Widgets were built with XML and JavaScript.
		The widget files delivered to users from the gallery were just relabeled ZIP archives
		and their contents can easily be examined or extracted.
		<br>
		In the archive would be:
		<ul>
			<li><b>[widget-name].kon</b>
			An XML file used by the engine to start the widget</li>
			<li><b>widget.xml</b>
			Used by the version 4 engine to configure its new widget dock</li>
			<li>JavaScript and resource files as needed</li>
		</ul>

		Here is the Smarter Stickies version 1.7 widget file:<br>

	</p><p>
		The Yahoo!! Widget Engine is still available on a few web sites and,
		according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Widgets">
		this Wikipedia article</a>,
		will still run on Windows 10.
		To get the images shown here,
		I chose to run my own archived copy
		on an air-gapped virtual Windows XP instance.
