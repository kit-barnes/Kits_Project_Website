		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentago" target="-blank">Pentago</a>
		is a 2 player game invented by Tomas Flod&eacute;n.
		The players alternate placing marbles on a 6 by 6 field,
		trying to get 5 of their own marbles in a straight line.
		The complication is that the board is divided into four 3 by 3 quadrants,
		one of which must be rotated 90 degrees by the player after placing a marble.
	</p><p>
		I'd never heard of Pentago before I was given a copy as a Christmas present in 2008.
		I enjoyed playing the game, but after the holiday visits were over,
		lacked willing opponents.
		So I decided to build one.

		I first chose Macromedia Flash for my implementation
		because of the ease with which graphics could be rotated
		and its broad browser support (at the time).
		It was exposed to the world at my former web site on home.att.net
		and advertised to family and friends.
	</p><p>
		From a June 22, 2009 email:
		<blockquote>
		Yep, yet another Pentago version.
		<br>
		I fixed the bug KC pointed out and, as long as I was fooling around with the code anyway decided to try out an idea I had for a mobile phone (or other limited-screen-size) version.  I've downloaded the freely distributed development tools for the Android platform and am in the process of learning how to build apps for those phones.
		<br>
		My idea offers one way to avoid the extra space around the board required to slide out the quadrants, allowing a larger (and easier to operate) board.  Since I don't really consider it a game option, I didn't bother to put a control for it on the Options panel - It's hidden away. Flash applications (and some elements in them) can have context menus which appear when a user right-clicks (Windows) or Control-clicks (Macintosh) on them.  You will find such a menu (with a custom item) when you right-(or Control)-click on any of the twist controls in the new version.
		</blockquote>

		My browser of choice no longer supports Flash,
		but Internet Explorer under Windows 10 runs my old files with a minimum of fuss.

		Despite the email above,
		Android was not the next platform for my code.
		Rummaging through old directories of source code,
		I stumbled across this unremembered version.
		I'm guessing the idea was to get the code translated to Java
		before venturing into the unknown territory of Android.
		While it is written as an applet, I have not found any evidence of
		(nor do I remember)
		it having ever been included in a web page.
	</p><p>
		Two things about this version surprised me.
		First: the graphics are better than the Flash version
		(better highlighting and rounded corners).
		Second: while it uses the mobile style twisters,
		it does not use the mobile style twist animation.

		This is the version I've been playing on and off on my phones since
		I bought my first Android phone July 21, 2012.
		The latest APK was built in September 2012, but its source files go back to 2010.
		I think that first phone came with Gingerbread
		but the APK targets the older Android version Froyo.
		The app was fully functional and running on the emulator
		of the Android Development Toolkit by the end of 2010
		when I sent a copy to my son (who already had an Android phone).
	</p><p>
		I don't remember why the highlights (on the marbles and dimples)
		are missing from this version.
		Most likely I initially skipped them for simplicity's sake
		then either forgot or didn't bother to go back and add them.
		I do remember deciding to simplify the controls.
		I felt that a fingertip was nowhere near precise enough
		(unlike a mouse pointer) to operate the move-recording bar
		of the web-based versions.
		The touch interface did, however, allow me to do away with the twist controls:
		a brief flick of a finger will trigger a quadrant's rotation.
		Much more intuitive and esthetically pleasing.
		Less pleasing is the way I stuffed the whole interface to the top of the screen.
		I should have at least made the status message at the top of the screen
		take up more space and lowered the buttons and maybe made them bigger.
		Since the APK carries a version of 0.8, I did not consider it finished.
	</p><p>
		I improved the maximum strength of the computer opponent in this version,
		and reduced the number of difficulty levels to four,
		including one that makes completely random moves.
		I remember being able to beat the highest level occasionally,
		back when I was working on the code and playing a lot.
		Now I only play once or twice in a long while and,
		despite that I set the difficulty lower,
		I almost always find myself losing.
	</p><p>
		The app requires no permissions and works on all the current versions of Android
		to date, including Android Q.  It even works in split screen,
		although the buttons disappear.
