		Gobblet Noob is an Android app that plays the game
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobblet" target="_blank" >Gobblet</a>.
		Originally built using the Android Development Toolkit in Eclipse,
		the app is currently built with Android Studio.
		The game of Gobblet was designed by Thierry Denoual.
	</p><p>
		The app provides four levels of computer opponent
		which can be selected to play either, neither, or both sides
		at any point in the game.
		Unlimited undo's allow you to back the game up and try again.
		
	</p><p>
		Here is a description of the game and its rules from the Help dialog of the app:
	</p><p style="padding 0px 32px 0px 32px">
		The object of the game is to get 4 of your cups in a row.
		Two players each have 12 inverted cups initially arranged in 3 nested stacks off the board.
		White moves first. Cups may be placed over smaller cups.
		Cups moved from off the board must be placed on an empty position
		unless the cup they cover is one of an opposing 3-in-a-row.
		You lose if you uncover a win unless you can cover another cup in the win.
		Draws can occur by agreement or by moves repeated 3 times.
		If you cannot place a lifted piece you lose.
	</p><p>
		The app will only allow you to move one (of your own) cups at a time.
		Once you've picked up any of your cups
		(by touching it)
		you must move it to a different position on the board
		(by dragging it there or by just tapping the new position).
		You can tap UNDO quickly as many times as you want
		and that many moves will be undone at the speed of the animation.
	</p><p>
		I coded this app in 2012 for my Samsung Galaxy S3 (running Ice Cream Sandwich)
		using the Android Development Tools plugin for the Eclipse IDE.
		I moved my code into Android Studio, raised the target API,
		and it built again without any code changes.
		I've been using the first version since 2012
		and it's currently working fine on Android Pie.
		If you're willing to trust both me and GitHub, you can install this APK:
